## On Games N' Data Plot

This package is a collection of functions that create plots in one line. My objective is to have a consistent look across all visualisations I need to produce without having to format every singe one of them and, whenever possible, write only one line of code.

## Available visualisations

__Scatter Plot and Bubble Chart__

Plots a scatter plot with scatter_plot(). Supports color and size, handling both automatically. Can be used with isolated vectors or data.frame columns.
